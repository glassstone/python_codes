# python_codes
Scientific analysis codes dedicated to calculate cloud properties (cloud optical thickness, cloud particle effective radius, and cloud thermodynamic phase)
These clouds properties are retrieved using zenith spectral radiance measurements taken with the 4STAR instrument onboard airborne research platforms.
The various codes show the process of cloud property retrievals for data taken during the TCAP field mission and the SEAC4RS field mission. 
In addition to retrieval codes, there are codes for comparison of flight path retrieved properties to satellite data (MODIS and GOES), to other airborne remote sensors (imagers, lidars) and in situ measurements.


The codes contained herein are for science analysis. 
The very nature of this research promotes evolving programs, thus legacy codes may still be prominent, with some lack in documentation.

Collection of python codes for analysis of data taken with 4STAR
These python codes are to be used in the ipython notebook
